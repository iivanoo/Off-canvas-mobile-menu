A simple good looking off canvas menu, specifically developed for mobile devices.

The menu has been developed for leveraging the CSS3 features as much as possible,
and it may be imported into already existing SASS stylesheets.

A fully functioning demo can be accessed here (better to access it via a mobile
device as standard browsers may show some glitches): [DEMO](http://codepen.io/iivanoo/full/WvWXqR/)

The example comes with Typicons 1.9.1 (but it can work without it as well).
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/typicons/typicons.min.css">

Below you can find a screenshot of the opened menu.
